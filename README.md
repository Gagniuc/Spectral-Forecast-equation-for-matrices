# Spectral Forecast equation for matrices
A more complex example that uses the spectral forecast equation is related to matrices. A question that can be asked this time would be: given two matrices A and B, what would a third matrix (M) look like if it must resemble both A and B in a certain proportion? For instance, a matrix M may be required to resemble matrix A in a proportion of 60% and matrix B for the remaining proportion of 40%. This is exactly what the spectral equation provides, namely a direct way of obtaining such an intermediary matrix. Moreover, the Spectral Forecast equation can also be applied to signals (one dimension), but also to mathematical objects with more than two dimensions.
